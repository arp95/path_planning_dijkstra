Project 2 - ENPM661:


Authors:
Arpit Aggarwal Markose Jacob (Group 3)


Instructions for running the code:
To run the code for finding the path, follow the following commands:


```
cd codes
python Dijkstra_point.py 
```


```
cd codes
python Dijkstra_rigid.py
```


Result:
The blue region is the explored region. The green region is the unexplored region. And lastly, the red region is the path from the start node to goal node.

For example:
For the start node (5, 5), goal node (195, 295), radius = 0 and clearance = 0, the time taken is 15 seconds.


Software Required:
To run the .py files, use Python 3. Standard Python 3 libraries like numpy, heapq and OpenCV are used.
